	<h3>Welcome!</h3>
	<p>I am a sophomore studying Computer Science at Harvard University. Designing things is my passion, and I truly envision myself working with an agile team to hone my skill set. I have always been fascinated by technological development; however, my interests also branch out to acting and psychology. I seek to apply the technical skills I gain at Harvard to pursue my passions. </p>
